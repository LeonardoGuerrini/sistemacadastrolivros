# Simple Book Registration System

This is a personal project and goal is practice my PHP fundamentals. In this application, it's possible to create an account in the system, log in and log out, register and delete a book.
## Using

When you open the app, the first page will be the login page. If you already have an account, just fill in the fields and log in; otherwise, you will need to create a new account.

To register an account, you will only need your name, date of birth, email address, a username, and a password. You can then return to the login page.

After logging in, you will be directed to the main page, where you can see all the books registered. On the same page, you can delete a book from the system by simply entering the book ID.

In the navigation bar, there are four tabs: Main Page, Book Registration, My Account, and Logout.

On the Book Registration page, you can register a book in the system and enter its information, such as genre, price, etc.

On the My Account page, you can view all your information, except for the password you entered when you registered. And your account ID.

The Logout tab will log you out immediately.
